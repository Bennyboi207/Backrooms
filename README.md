# Empty Unity Project

Note: this project is intentionally using a "trailing edge" version of Unity. Upgrading from an older version of Unity to a newer version generally works, but going the other direction is not supported and is often problematic. So, feel free to upgrade, but if you're planning to work with the project in a school lab or on some other machine where you don't have privilages to upgrade Unity, double check the installed version there before upgrading. Unity Hub makes it relatively easy to install older versions of Unity.
